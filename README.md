Future Plans : 
- Vue3 + Typescript migration
- User authentication and save game templates
- More pre-defined variants (teleportation portals, duck chess, long range attacks, poisoned pawn/hidden queen)
- Chess engine to mimic computer opponent bot (In the works - [Stonkfish](https://github.com/vishnkr/stonkfish))
